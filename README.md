# Font smoothing
For some reason, Japanese websites prefer to load their own font, which often shows up un-antialiased. 

To improve readability, this extension trusts that browsers can display the characters of the original font using its native font _somewhat faithfully_, so as to not cause layout-breaking changes. 

Unless you are using some ancient browser, for which you can't since you need to install this extension, the system default font should be a drop-in replacement. 

_We live in an age of Unicode... Don't get me started on the allergy of half-width characters._

Though, this tool is rapidly developed with the explicit help of Generative AI, namely poe.com, so you could argue it has something to do with HKUST Extended Major in AI [\(22-23extm-ai.pdf\)](https://ugadmin.hkust.edu.hk/prog_crs/ug/202223/pdf/22-23extm-ai.pdf)
